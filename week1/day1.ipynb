Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

Supported Sensors\n\n| Sensor Type          | Communication Protocols  | Description                       |\n|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Temperature Sensor    | I2C, SPI, Analog         | Measures ambient temperature    |\n| Humidity Sensor       | I2C                      | Measures relative humidity      |\n| Accelerometer        | I2C, SPI                 | Measures acceleration/motion    |\n| Light Sensor         | I2C, Analog              | Measures ambient light levels   |\n| Gas Sensor           | Analog                   | Detects gases like CO2, CO       |\n| Pressure Sensor      | I2C, SPI                 | Measures atmospheric pressure   |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How to Connect Sensors\n\n### Hardware connections:\n- **I2C Sensors**: Connect to microcontroller **SDA** and **SCL** pins.\n- **SPI Sensors**: Connect to **MOSI**, **MISO**, **SCLK**, and **CS** pins accordingly.\n- **Analog Sensors**: Connect to **ADC** input pins.\n\n### Example connection for I2C sensor:\n```plaintext\nSensor SDA --- MCU SDA Pin (e.g., GPIO21)\nSensor SCL --- MCU SCL Pin (e.g., GPIO22)\nPower       --- 3.3V or 5V (as per sensor spec)\nGround      --- GND\n```\n\n### Example connection for SPI sensor:\n```plaintext\nSensor MOSI --- MCU MOSI Pin\nSensor MISO --- MCU MISO Pin\nSensor SCLK --- MCU SCLK Pin\nSensor CS   --- MCU GPIO for Chip Select\nPower       --- 3.3V or 5V\nGround      --- GND\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Configuration Requirements\n\n### Firmware Configuration:\n- Enable and initialize communication protocol drivers (I2C/SPI/ADC).\n- Configure GPIO pins for correct mode and pull-ups (especially for I2C).\n- Load sensor-specific drivers or libraries.\n- Set sensor-specific parameters like sampling rate, gain, thresholds.\n\n### IoT Platform Configuration:\n- Register sensor IDs in the platform database.\n- Map sensor data streams to appropriate dashboards.\n- Set data reporting intervals and alert thresholds.\n- Configure network connectivity (WiFi, LTE, etc.) for sensor data uplink.\n\n### Example Pseudocode for Initialization (I2C Temperature Sensor):\n```c\n// Initialize I2C peripheral\ni2c_init(SDA_PIN, SCL_PIN, I2C_CLOCK_SPEED);\n\n// Initialize Temperature sensor driver\ntemp_sensor_init(i2c_bus);\n\n// Set reporting interval\ntemp_sensor_set_reporting_interval(1000); // 1 second\n\n// Start sensor measurement\ntemp_sensor_start();\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary Checklist\n\n| Step                         | Description                         |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Hardware connection          | Connect sensor pins to MCU        |\n| Protocol initialization      | Setup I2C/SPI/ADC in firmware     |\n| Sensor driver installation   | Include sensor-specific firmware  |\n| Platform registration        | Register sensor in IoT platform   |\n| Data reporting configuration | Set intervals & data formats      |\n\nIf you want, I can provide sensor-specific connection diagrams or firmware code snippets."
